        <h3>Affordances</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>A user can communicate with another user or a group of users using text messages or video/audio calls.
          </li>
          <li>A user connected to a video/audio channel can write on other channels during the session.</li>
          <li>The server owner can assign roles to users so that they have different rights on the server, such as
            access to different channels, permissions to modify other users' rights.</li>
          <li>A user can share their screen or certain windows within a channel.</li>
          <li>A user can upload files from their device to a specific channel.</li>
          <li>inDuring a session, the user can detach the window of the shared content from the main window of the
            application.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Visual Variables</h3>
        <h4>Structure</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Organizes messages into channels so that users can view and access messages in a structured way. This can
            include labels or categories for channels and search filters.</li>
          <li>On the left side of the window, there are server icons, a list of channels, users connected to a channel
            (which appear under the channel name), the channel that the user is connected to with the functions they can
            use, the username and profile picture with a green or red dot representing the status, and the rest of the
            space is occupied by chat or in the case of a voice/video channel, the images of users or the shared screen
            will appear in this space.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Design</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>User interface design: has a modern and attractive design, with clear and easy-to-use interface elements.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Size</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>The size of the elements differs: The icons for navigation and discovering features are small because
            navigation is simple and intuitive. </li>
          <li>The large elements are the list of channels and the images and video cameras of the participants or the
            shared screen.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Colors</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>The main colors used are neutral: black, gray, and white. Images and icons can have different colors, and
            the text can also be edited using tags to appear different from the default. </li>
          <li> During a session, a user can disconnect by clicking a red button.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Interaction flow</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>A user creates a server and can distribute an invitation link to other users.</li>
          <li>Other users access that link and connect to that server and will have access to the channels existing on
            that server.</li>
          <li>Users will connect to a specific channel and will have access to the shared content and conversation
            within that channel.</li>
          <li>Users can disconnect at any time by clicking the red "disconnect" button or by clicking the disconnect
            button on the left side of the window that appears when connecting to a channel.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Metaphors and Idioms</h3>
        <ol>
          <li> Metaphores</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Icons for audio (microphone), for sound (headphones), and for video (camera), the first two appear in
              both normal mode, that is, in the "On" mode, and in the "Off" mode, being cut off by a red line;</li>
            <li>Icons to use an emoticon;</li>
            <li>The Exit button, represented by a microphone next to which there is an "x" in a red dot;</li>
            <li>Icon for screen sharing (screen with an arrow).</li>
          </ul>
          <li> Idioms</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The button to start an activity represented by a "rocket" icon.</li>
            <li>The button to take the player to another window, represented by a square icon with an arrow pointing
              outward.</li>
          </ul>
        </ol>


        <p> Discord has implemented a text-only section, meaning that users do not have to be connected to an audio
          channel to write.</p>
        For strictly non-audio interaction:
        <ul>
          <li>On the left side, under a certain channel, the names of the users writing on that channel should appear.
          </li>
          <li>Next to the user, there should be a white "keyboard" icon if they have sent a message in the last 5
            minutes, and a red one if they haven't.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cognitive overload</h3>
        <p>Discord allows users to create multiple channels for different subjects or purposes. While this can be useful
          for organization, it can also be overwhelming for students trying to keep up with multiple conversations
          happening in multiple channels at the same time. This can be particularly difficult for students who are not
          familiar with the application or who have difficulties with multitasking.</p>
        <p> The application allows users to share a variety of rich media, including images, videos, and links. While
          these can be helpful for learning, they can also be overwhelming if too much information is presented at once.
          This can be exacerbated if students try to keep up with text conversations at the same time.
        </p>

        <h3>Improvements</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Issue:</b> Difficulty managing large servers with multiple channels and users.</li>
          <ul>

            <li>
              <p><b>Solution:</b> Introducing more advanced moderation tools for server owners and administrators, such
                as the ability to mass-delete messages or users, set custom roles and permissions, and schedule
                messages. Allowing users to create sub-channels within channels to organize conversations more
                efficiently.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <li><b>Issue:</b> Inconsistent design between desktop and mobile applications </li>
          <ul>

            <li>
              <p><b>Solution:</b> Ensuring consistency in general design, look, and user interface across both
                platforms, so that users can easily switch between the two without confusion. Using responsive design
                elements optimized for desktop and mobile screens to provide a seamless experience.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <li><b>Issue:</b> Limited integration with other applications and services.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p><b>Solution:</b> Allowing users to connect Discord to other applications and services, such as Google
                Drive, Trello, or GitHub, to make collaboration on projects and sharing of content easier. Providing
                more customization options for integrations, such as the ability to choose which channels or users to
                notify for specific events.</p>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </ol>

        <h3>Fitt's, Hick's, Steering</h3>
        <p>The empirical laws of Fitts, Hick, and Steering are commonly used in the context of human-computer
          interaction to describe how people interact with input devices such as mice, keyboards, and touchscreens. When
          considering multi-device interaction for Discord, these laws may still be applicable but need to be adapted:
        </p>

        <h4>Fitt's law</h4>
        <p><i>Fitt's law describes the relationship between the size of a target and the time it takes to reach it with
            a pointing device.</i></p>
        <p>In the context of multi-device interaction for Discord, this law may still be relevant but targets may be
          spread across multiple devices, such as a desktop computer and a mobile phone. As a result, the size of
          targets and the distance between them may need to be adjusted to accommodate for different screen sizes and
          input methods.</p>

        <h4>Hick's law</h4>
        <p><i>Hick's law describes the relationship between the number of options and the time it takes to make a
            decision.</i></p>
        <p>In the context of Discord, users may have multiple options to interact with the platform across multiple
          devices, such as voice chat, text chat, and video chat. To reduce decision time, grouping similar functions or
          options between devices may be considered to minimize the number of options presented to the user at any given
          time.</p>

        <h4>Steering law</h4>
        <p><i>Steering law describes the relationship between the movement of a cursor and the direction of
            movement.</i></p>
        <p>In the context of multi-device interaction for Discord, the cursor may not always be present as users may
          interact with the platform through touchscreens or voice commands. Therefore, the application needs
          alternative input methods such as gestures or voice recognition to allow users to interact with the platform
          in a natural and intuitive way across multiple devices</p>


        <h3>Features</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Game store:</b> it could integrate a game store feature that allows users to purchase games and other
            game-related items directly through the platform.

            <p> Users could access the store through a separate tab in the application interface and browse games by
              genre, platform, and popularity. When a user buys a game, it could be automatically added to their Discord
              library, and they could see what games their friends are playing.</p>
          </li>

          <li><b>Transcription tool:</b> a transcription tool could be added that automatically transcribes voice and
            video chat conversations into text. This would make it easier for users to read messages and find important
            information without having to listen to entire conversations. The transcription tool could be accessed
            through a button in the chat window, and users could turn it on or off.</p>
          </li>

          <li><b>Calendar:</b> a calendar feature could be added that allows users to schedule events and reminders
            directly through the platform.
            <p>Users can create and manage events from a separate tab in the interface. The calendar could sync with
              other calendar applications, such as Google Calendar, to ensure users don't miss important events.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Here are three accessibility improvements that could be made to Discord, based on existing accessibility
          features:</p>

        <div class="responsive">
          <div class="polaroid">
            <img src="srs.png" alt="Improved screen reader support">
            <div class="container">
              <b>Improved screen reader support:</b>
              <p> Currently, Discord offers some support for screen readers, but it could be improved by adding more
                descriptive labels for buttons and fields, ensuring keyboard shortcuts are accessible through screen
                readers, and improving the overall navigation experience for users who rely on them.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="responsive">
          <div class="polaroid">
            <img src="contr.png" alt="Contrast mode">
            <div class="container">
              <b>Contrast mode:</b>
              <p> Discord currently has light and dark themes, but a contrast mode could be added. The contrast mode
                could be especially useful for users with visual impairments and could improve the readability and
                overall usability of the platform.
              </p>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="responsive">
          <div class="polaroid">
            <img src="t2s.png" alt="Improved subtitles">
            <div class="container">
              <b>Improved subtitles:</b>
              <p>Subtitles for voice and video chats could be improved by adding a few features, such as the ability to
                customize font size and color, the ability to adjust the position of subtitles on the screen, and the
                ability to quickly turn subtitles on and off during a chat.

        <p> <span class="u-c"><b>Use case: Online meeting between student and thesis advisor/professor.</b></span></p>
        <p>

        <h3>Affordances</h3>
        <p>A user who uses this communication application is able to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>communicate with another user or group of users, either using an audio system or text messages;
          </li>
          <li>use the device's camera to create a new interaction interface;</li>
          <li>share the screen live or individually various windows;</li>
          <li>share files that are on the device used;</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Visual Variables</h3>
        <p>The visual aspects of the elements that make up the communication interface, position, size, color, etc.
          helps users to focus on communicating with the rest of the people participating in the conversation.
        </p>
        <h4>Position</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>the element/image that represents the main speaker is always placed in the center of the interface,
            replacing, if necessary, the previous speaker.
          </li>
          <li>if they are activated, the chat for text messages and the list of participants are positioned on the right
            side, the chat being placed at the bottom to be more easily accessible.
          </li>
          <li>bthe application-specific buttons are placed separately from the previously mentioned elements, also at
            the bottom for accessibility.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Size</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>the largest element of the interface is the element of the main speaker, possibly replaced by his video
            camera, this element will prioritize (if applicable) to show the screen shared by a participant;
          </li>
          <li>the elements for the list of participants and chat are smaller because they offer a moderate level of
            information;
          </li>
          <li>the functional buttons are the smallest elements in the interface, being rarely needed, some being used
            only once within a single conversation;
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Colour</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>the application only uses neutral colors, black, shades of gray, white writing, the only colors used being
            green for connecting and red for closing the call. This color scheme does not contain gaudy shades so as not
            to distract users.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Interaction flow</h3>
        <p>For the conversation itself, we can outline the following flow:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a user starts a communication room being assigned host;</li>
          <li>other users who intend to participate, use a special link to enter the respective room;</li>
          <li>opening the link presents users with an interface that confirms information about the user, and that
            allows them to set certain options (camera, microphone, both the component used and whether it is turned on
            or not) before participating in the conversation;
          </li>
          <li>once entered the room, the user can participate in the conversation and has access to all the
            functionalities presented in the "Affordances" category.
          </li>
          <li>once the purpose of the conversation is completed, the user can disconnect using the "Leave meeting"
            button
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Metaphors and Idioms:</h3>
        <p>
          The metaphors used to easily illustrate the functionalities to the user are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The icons for audio (microphone) and video (camera), both in the normal version, white outline and in the
            "Off" mode using the red color instead;
          </li>
          <li>Icons for accessing the list of participants, chat;</li>
          <li>IIcons to raise your hand or use another emoticon;</li>
          <li>the Exit button, using an X;</li>
          <li>File sharing</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For a text-only type of interaction, we can implement several columns in the following way:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Participants column:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Contains the list of all participants, those who participate verbally in the conversation will have a
              white dot to the left of their name;/li>
          </ul>
          <li>Chat column;</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Contains the messages sent, in order, accompanied by who sent the message and when.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Options column:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Show/hide participants/chat;</li>
            <li>Share file;</li>
            <li>Leave the call</li>
            <li>etc</li>
          </ul>
        </ol>



        <p>Idioms, icons that do not accurately describe the purpose of the button, introducing new concepts to the
          user:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The button for sharing, accompanied by the icon for New Whiteboard</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Cognitive overload</h3>
        There is a possibility of cognitive overload in the following case:
        Several users are connected to the communication room, each with the microphone on (and the camera). All users
        want to communicate something, too many discussions are heard, which becomes worse if these discussions are also
        on different topics. In this chaotic scenario, there is too much information for any user, making it difficult
        to process the information.


        <h3>Improvements</h3>
        <p>Webex being mainly an application for serious conversations, both the comfort of the users and the integrity
          of the conversation must be ensured, thus, we propose the following improvements, these improvements do not
          depend on the platform used and can be implemented in a general way, either native mobile, native desktop or
          Web :
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Maximum volume tolerated:</b>
            <p>This improvement would allow users with sensitive hearing to set a maximum level for the volume that
              could stop the audio that exceeds this level, or even modify it to be reduced to the maximum level
              allowed.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li><b>Maximum speakers tolerated:</b>
            <p>This improvement aims to stop situations similar to the scenario presented in the "Cognitive overload"
              chapter, each audio input will go into a slot that is allowed to communicate verbally with the users. If
              all slots are occupied, the maximum is reached, and any audio input is ignored until slots are freed. The
              number of slots can be preset before the creation of the communication room, or constantly modified by the
              host;
            </p>
          </li>

          <li><b>Auto-off/censor shared content:</b>
            <p>This improvement allows the user to start a system that either censors or completely stops a potential
              video or audio input that is not beneficial to the conversation. There will be options to select what kind
              of information is detected by this system: violence, vulgar language or even themes that aim to distract
              attention from the main conversation.

        <h3>Fitt's, Hick's, Steering</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Within this empirical law, we focus on the time required to move the cursor between the buttons:
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>The buttons are generally located either on the right side of the screen, for functionalities that do
              not influence the conversation, or at the bottom for those that have this possibility. Thus we have
              buttons grouped by functionality, at a relatively short distance;
            </li>
            <li>The size of the buttons is kept small so as not to distract users, however, it is a comfortable size to
              allow easy operation by users;
            </li>
          </ul>

          <li>Hicks' law mentions the relationship between the number of options at a given moment, and the time to make
            a choice:
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>Being already limited in number of options, we can give as an example the sharing scenario:<i> The user
                is presented with several menus grouped by the type of sharing: Screen, File, Camera.</i> Thus, not all
              options are always presented and the user can quickly choose the desired sharing method.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <li>The time required to travel through a 2-dimensional tunnel is relatively small, which is supported by the
            other two empirical laws, the time to navigate through the interface and the time to choose one of several
            options being kept at small intervals.
          </li>
        </ol>

              <p>This function can be activated by any user to make file transfer easy. When starting this setting, the
                person requesting the files can include both a description of the desired file and a condition for the
                date of the last significant change in the requested file. (Ex: a teacher asks some students for
                homework)

              <b>Remote helper</b>
              <p>This function allows a user1 to ask another user2 to share the screen of only user1 and create a text
                window and a cursor instance on the screen of user2, practically both users work on the same screen. The
                2 elements are operated by user1 and can be used to guide user2.
                We can imagine a functionality similar to the TeamViewer application, BUT there is no remote connection
                to another computer, only elements that make remote guidance easier are instantiated.

              <b>App hosted share</b>
              <p>This functionality allows a user to upload a document in any format to be viewed without sharing the
                document itself or the screen, thus the quick and temporary information will not take up space on the
                device of other users and there is no risk that the information will not be visible from due to a bad
                connection during screen sharing.
